The Data Encryption Standard (DES) is a symmetric-key algorithm for encryption. Here are the general steps:

1. **Key Generation**: The 64-bit encryption key is used to generate sixteen 48-bit round keys.

2. **Initial Permutation (IP)**: The 64-bit plaintext is permuted according to a fixed table.
